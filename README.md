# ~~ About Me ~~

I'm a software developer in training with Mission Ready HQ, currently working through Level 5 after earning my Level 4 Full Stack Development certification.

I’m passionate about the world of AI and always exploring how tech can be used to build smarter, more helpful systems. I’ve worked on generative AI-powered Discord and Twitch bots, built a CLI assistant, and developed various web tools using JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB.

I’m also curious about cybersecurity and game development — both fascinate me for the challenges and creativity they bring.

Currently sharpening my Python skills and diving deeper into backend development, I’m looking for opportunities that combine creativity with real-world problem-solving — especially in AI or security.

Let’s build something clever together.
