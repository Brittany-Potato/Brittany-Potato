# ~~ About Me ~~

Level 6 Diploma in Advanced Full-Stack Software Development. I have an eye for creative solutions and a strong drive to learn and grow. I am mainly interested in AI, Cyber Security, Networking and brushing a bit of game development. I have quite a few different personal projects I dabble with including a JavaScript 'Dictionary', Python 'Dictionary, the start of a 'C#' Dictionary and my website, plus a few hidden projects.

I am familiar with JavaScript, I am also self teaching Python and a little bit of C# and TypeScript. If you want to build something together just holla! I would love some new projects, challenges and a chance to collaborate!
